## My process

- I start with prerequisites like fonts, images, icons etc.
- I try to write the html and css simultaneously rather than writing the whole of    html and then jump to css.
- Try to use html semantics rather than using div for elements.
- Only use divs for styling and for using flex and grid.
- Work on the responsiveness as I build each section.
- Try to give "em" for sizing elements, because, I need not change whole of font-sizes for elements while using media queries.
- Just change the font-size of body in media queries and all the element sizes and paddings will be adjusted automatically;


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I especially attempted this project to learn about the placements of background svgs and illustrations.

- learnt the usage of before and after pseudo-selectors for placing svgs.
- Used 'em' on almost all the styles.
- All about overflows
- clean Responsiveness

### Continued development

- Will surely use 'em' until I find a drawback using it.
